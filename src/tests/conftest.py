def fix_async_db(request):
    """
    If you don't use this fixture for async tests that use the ORM/database
    you won't get proper teardown of the database.
    This is a bug somewhere in pytest-django, pytest-asyncio or django itself.

    Nobody knows how to solve it, or who should solve it.
    Workaround here: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/issues/226#issuecomment-2225156564
    More info:
    https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-django/issues/580
    https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/issues/226


    The actual implementation of this workaround consists on ensuring
    Django always returns the same database connection independently of the thread
    the code that requests a db connection is in.

    We were unable to use better patching methods (the target is asgiref/local.py),
    so we resorted to mocking the _lock_storage context manager so that it returns a Mock.
    That mock contains the default connection of the main thread (instead of the connection
    of the running thread).

    This only works because our tests only ever use the default connection, which is the only thing our mock returns.
